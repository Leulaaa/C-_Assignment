# 🔢 C++ Menu-Driven Program – Loops, 2D Arrays, and Functions

This is a C++ console-based application that demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as loops, 2D arrays, and functions in a user-friendly, menu-driven format.

📋 Features
Upon execution, users are greeted with a menu that allows them to choose from the following:

Using Loop
Displays a pyramid structure of odd numbers from 1 to 59 using while and for loops.

Using 2D Array
Populates a 5x6 two-dimensional array with odd numbers from 1 to 59 and displays the array in a tabular format.

Using Functions
Calculates and displays:

The sum of all odd numbers from 1 to 59.

The average of these odd numbers.

🛠️ How It Works
The program uses a do-while loop to continuously prompt the user until they choose to exit.

Input validation is minimal—make sure to enter valid integers when prompted.

The program handles each feature in a separate block of code for clarity.
